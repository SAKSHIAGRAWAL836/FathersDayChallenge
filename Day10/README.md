🚀 Day 10 – #50DaysOfCode

Challenged myself with two thought-provoking LeetCode problems today. One leaned on classic pointer logic, while the other was a clean example of mathematical pattern recognition.

✅ Problems Solved  
1. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Approach:** Slow and fast pointer  
**Concepts:** Linked list traversal, in-place deletion  
**Description:** Remove the middle node by using two pointers—fast moves twice as fast as slow, allowing us to find the node just before the middle.

2. Bulb Switcher  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Approach:** Perfect square observation  
**Concepts:** Math, number theory  
**Description:** Determine how many bulbs remain ON after n rounds of toggling. Turns out, only bulbs at perfect square positions remain ON.

💡 Learnings  
- Mastered another use-case of the slow-fast pointer technique.  
- Discovered how mathematical patterns (like perfect squares) simplify what looks like a simulation problem.  
- Small lines of logic can replace big blocks of code when you understand the pattern.

🛠️ Tech Stack  
**Language:** Python 3  
**Platform:** LeetCode  

📌 Notes  
- Math and pointers are powerful tools when combined with logical reasoning.  
- Today’s problems reminded me that simplicity in solution often hides behind complexity in the problem description.
