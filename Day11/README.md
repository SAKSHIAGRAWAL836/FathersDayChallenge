âœ¨ Problems Solved:
Remove Nth Node From End of List

Difficulty: Medium

Concepts: Linked List, Two Pointers

Approach: Used a dummy node and the two-pointer technique. Advanced the fast pointer n steps ahead, then moved both fast and slow until fast reached the end. This allowed removing the nth node from the end in a single pass.

Time Complexity: O(L) where L is the length of the list.

Factorial Trailing Zeroes

Difficulty: Medium

Concepts: Math, Logarithmic Thinking

Approach: Counted the number of 5s in the prime factorization of all numbers up to n. This determines how many trailing zeroes n! will have.

Time Complexity: O(log n)

ðŸ”¥ Key Learnings:
How dummy nodes simplify edge cases in linked list problems.

Efficient handling of factorial trailing zeros using division logic rather than full multiplication.

The two-pointer approach is powerful for problems involving relative positioning in a list.
