## ðŸ§  Approach:

Optimized using **1D Dynamic Programming**:
- Use an array `res` of size `rowIndex + 1`
- Start with `res[0] = 1`
- For each row from 1 to `rowIndex`, update values from right to left:
  ```python
  for i in range(1, rowIndex+1):
      for j in range(i, 0, -1):
          res[j] += res[j - 1]
