### Day 32 – May 31, 2025

**Today’s Progress**:
- Solved 2 LeetCode Medium Problems:
  1. [102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)
     - Used Breadth-First Search (BFS) with a queue
     - Collected node values level-by-level
  2. [48. Rotate Image](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/)
     - Reversed the matrix and transposed it
     - Achieved in-place 90-degree rotation

**What I Learned**:
- Efficient queue-based traversal for tree structures
- Matrix manipulation tricks for in-place transformation
- How reversing + transposing gives a clean rotation

**Next Goal**: More matrix problems and sliding window practice!

⏳ Streak: Day 32/50
