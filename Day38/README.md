2. [700. Search in a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/)

---

### ✅ 1. Valid Palindrome  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topic:** Two Pointers, String  

**Approach:**  
- Used a two-pointer approach to move from both ends of the string inward.  
- Skipped non-alphanumeric characters using `isalnum()`  
- Compared characters after converting them to lowercase.

**Key Learning:**  
- Efficient string cleanup and palindrome validation.  
- Hands-on with character-level string manipulation in Python.

### ✅ 2. Search in a Binary Search Tree  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Topic:** Binary Tree, BST  

**Approach:**  
- Performed recursive search based on BST properties.  
- Compared `val` with `root.val` and moved left or right accordingly.

**Key Learning:**  
- Applied binary search logic to tree traversal.  
- Practiced clean recursive function structure using base cases.
