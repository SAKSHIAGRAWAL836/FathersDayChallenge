class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head is None or head.next is None:
            return head
        cur, n = head, 0
        while cur:
            n += 1
            cur = cur.next
        k %= n
        if k == 0:
            return head
        fast = slow = head
        for _ in range(k):
            fast = fast.next
        while fast.next:

        ans = slow.next
        slow.next = None
