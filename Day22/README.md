# ðŸ“… LeetCode Journey â€” Day 22

Today I tackled two problems: one on string manipulation using a stack and another classic majority vote problem. Steady progress!

## âœ… Problems Solved

### 1. [1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/) â€” `Medium`

**Concepts:** Stack, String  
**Approach:**  
- First pass: Use a stack to track unmatched `(` and mark indices of invalid `)`.
- Second pass: Build a valid string by skipping all invalid indices.

**What I learned:**  
- Balancing parentheses efficiently with a stack.
- Two-pass cleanup is a handy technique for string problems.

### 2. [169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/) â€” `Easy`

**Concepts:** Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm  
**Approach:**  
- Maintain a `count` and a `candidate`.
- If the count hits 0, change the candidate.
- Works since a majority element appears more than âŒŠn / 2âŒ‹ times.

**What I learned:**  
- Elegant O(n) time, O(1) space solution.
- Boyer-Moore is a must-know for interviews.
