🔍 Problems Solved:

1. 701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree  
   🔗 https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-binary-search-tree/  
   💬 Difficulty: Medium  
   📘 Concepts: BST, Recursion  
   🧠 Approach:
   - If the current node is null, return a new node with the value.
   - If val < root.val → recursively insert in the left subtree.
   - Else → insert in the right subtree.

2. 1047. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String  
   🔗 https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string/  
   💬 Difficulty: Easy  
   📘 Concepts: Stack, String Manipulation  
   🧠 Approach:
   - Use a stack to track characters.
   - If current char == stack top → pop.
   - Else → push current char to stack.
   - Join the stack to get the final string.

💡 What I Learned:
- BST insertions preserve structure using recursion and comparison.
- Stack is ideal for problems involving adjacent duplicates or undo actions.
- Took a short break due to IPL finals trip — back with full energy now! 💪
