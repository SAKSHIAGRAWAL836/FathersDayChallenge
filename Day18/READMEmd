# LeetCode Problem Solutions in Python 🐍

## ✅ Solved Problems:

### 1. [232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-queue-using-stacks/)
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Concepts Used:** Stack, Queue, FIFO simulation using two stacks
- **Approach:**
  - `push(x)` adds to stack1.
  - `pop()` and `peek()` transfer elements from `stack1` to `stack2` only when `stack2` is empty.
  - This ensures the front of the queue is accessible in `stack2`.
