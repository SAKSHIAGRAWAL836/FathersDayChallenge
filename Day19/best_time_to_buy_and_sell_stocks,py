# Approach:Track the minimum price seen so far and update the maximum profit at each step by checking the difference between the current price and the minimum price.

def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        sellOne = 0
        holdOne = -math.inf

        for price in prices:
            sellOne = max(sellOne, holdOne + price)
            holdOne = max(holdOne, -price)

        return sellOne
