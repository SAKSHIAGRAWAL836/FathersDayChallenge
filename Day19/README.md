# Day 18 - #50DaysOfLeetCode Challenge

Solved two classic problems today:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** (LeetCode 121 - Easy):  
Used a greedy strategy to track the lowest buying price (`holdOne`) and maximum profit (`sellOne`) while iterating through the prices. This helped find the optimal day to buy and sell to maximize profit.  
üß† Learned: How to simulate a transaction using dynamic tracking of price deltas.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Valid Parentheses** (LeetCode 20 - Easy):  
Implemented a stack-based solution to validate if all brackets are correctly opened and closed in order. Pushed expected closing brackets and verified them on encounter.  
üß† Learned: Efficient use of stacks to match brackets and handle edge cases like unmatched or out-of-order symbols.

‚úÖ Both problems accepted and tested successfully. Solidified understanding of greedy logic and stack-based validation today!
