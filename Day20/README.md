# LeetCode Day 20 - 🔁 Stack & GCD

### ✅ Problems Solved:
1. **Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation**  
   - Topic: Stack, Arithmetic  
   - Tags: Medium  
   - Learned to implement postfix evaluation using a stack and Python’s `operator` module.  
   - Revisited handling of integer division with truncation towards zero.

2. **Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array**  
   - Topic: Math  
   - Tags: Easy  
   - Implemented logic using Python’s `gcd()` function with `max()` and `min()` to solve GCD of extremes.

### 🚀 What I Learned:
- How postfix (Reverse Polish) expressions work.
- Efficient use of stack data structures for expression evaluation.
- Refreshed GCD fundamentals.
